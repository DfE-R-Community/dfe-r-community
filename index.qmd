Welcome to the DfE R Community Blog! This resource is updated by data
scientists in the (UK Government) Department for Education with posts
that we think others may also find useful/interesting. These may
include:

-   Announcements related to projects available at the [DfE R Community
    GitHub](https://github.com/DfE-R-Community)

-   Techniques/technologies/topical tips we want to draw attention to

-   Any other thoughts about how to make data science effective for
    organisations!

If you'd like to contribute, it's as easy as submitting a pull request
at the [project
repo](https://github.com/DfE-R-Community/dfe-r-community.github.io) on
GitHub.

Happy Coding! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ’»ðŸ“ˆ
