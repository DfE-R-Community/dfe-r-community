```{r setup}

# The following (commented) code can be used to create a post-specific lockfile. 
# This should be run interactively by copy/pasting into the RStudio console.
#
#    renv::snapshot("posts/2023-03-14-best-practice-essentials", prompt = FALSE)
#
# This records the R version you used, and the versions of any packages.
# Then, if anyone needs to re-render your post (potentially in the distant future), 
# the following call to `renv::use()` tells R to use those same versions of 
# packages when executing your code.
renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

# Best Practice: What and Why

In R there are many ways do get the job done. None of these are bad -
*the right code is the code that works*. That said, knowing what is best
practice and striving to keep it has big benefits:

-   Your code will be easier to write (less decisions for you to make)

-   Your code will be easier to read and maintain (other people will be
    familiar with the conventions you use)

-   You will improve as an analyst and developer

# DfE Standards for R

Wherever possible, as an organisation we seek to defer to industry
standards rather than creating our own. Broadly, we therefore recommend:

-   [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) for best-practice
    essentials

-   [The Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for a more
    rigorous overview of code styling

# A Best Practice Cheatsheet

For a quick primer on best-practice you can refer to the following
