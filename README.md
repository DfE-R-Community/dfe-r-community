# DfE R Community Blog

Welcome to the DfE R Community Blog! This resource is updated by data
scientists in the (UK Government) Department for Education with posts
that we think others may also find useful/interesting. These may
include:

-   Announcements related to projects available at the [DfE R Community
    GitHub](https://github.com/DfE-R-Community)

-   Techniques/technologies/topical tips we want to draw attention to

-   Any other thoughts about how to make data science effective for
    organisations!

## Steps for Contributing

1.  [Fork the repository and clone your fork](https://github.com/rstats-tln/fork-and-clone-repo)

2.  Check out a new branch named `post/title-of-your-post-here`

3.  Write your post! The easiest way to do this is to duplicate one of
    the folders in `posts`, rename the folder to be in the form
    `yyyy-mm-dd-post-title-here`, then edit the `index.qmd` file

    -   Don't forget to update the `author` field with your name!
    
    -   To preview your changes, use the 'Render' button in RStudio to
        serve a local version of the blog

4.  Once you're happy, commit your work and create a pull request. Once
    someone has reviewed and merged your pull request the published
    version of the blog will be automatically updated.

Happy Coding! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ’»ðŸ“ˆ
