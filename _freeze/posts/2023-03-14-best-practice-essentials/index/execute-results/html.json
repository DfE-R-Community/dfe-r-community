None of these are bad -\n*the right code is the code that works*. That said, knowing what is best\npractice and striving to keep it has big benefits:\n\n-   Your code will be easier to write (less decisions for you to make)\n\n-   Your code will be easier to read and maintain (other people will be\n    familiar with the conventions you use)\n\n-   You will improve as an analyst and developer\n\n# DfE Standards for R\n\nWherever possible, as an organisation we seek to defer to industry\nstandards rather than creating our own. Broadly, we therefore recommend:\n\n-   [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) for best-practice\n    essentials\n\n-   [The Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for a more\n    rigorous overview of code styling\n\n# A Best Practice Cheatsheet\n\nFor a quick primer on best-practice you can refer to the following\ncheatsheet:\n\n[![](ppt/cheatsheet.jpg)](ppt/cheatsheet.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n[View at full resolution](ppt/cheatsheet.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}",
